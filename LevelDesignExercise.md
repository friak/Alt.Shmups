# This is a level about false expectations.

The level at first comes across as a very simple and easy level, but toward the end you realize you missed something. That one gap you instinctually jump over is actually the way to the real path that will get you to the end of the level. and it's more a traditional albeit linear level. I want to see if I was successful in manipulating the player's natural gut feeling of forward momentum and passive interaction.

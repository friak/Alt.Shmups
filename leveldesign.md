#Papers Please

I 've always appreciated the the subtlety that Papers, Please brings to guiding the player through the unorthodox gameplay of it. 

The call to action seems pretty straight forward; to make sure that everyone passing the customs border has their paperwork together and legal.
However, the deeper calls revolve around the decision making to get people through or out of the border based on the politcal discourse that slowly unravels before the player.
The direct quality is shown through the build up in introducing the task mananaging game elements to the player. The player gets more and more efficient in task managing all the paperwork as different mechanics are introduced in each level.
This is effective in its pacing especiallly when reevaluating just how good the player is at these mechanics when they start the game over and see how much will be built up. 

The methods that can be considered as indirect guidance is facilited through a number of ways. The constraints and goals come narratively in Papers, Please due to the discourse as the protagonist sometimes losing the freedom to do basic mechanics or given hard decisions where playing the game "wrong" leads to opportunities and story development. The player is subtly guided to be more strategic outside the basic task managing.
The physical interface also helps guide the player in terms of the disorganization to further the intensity and difficulty of the game. The visuals also provoke a sense of realism that make decision making and the overall game tense.

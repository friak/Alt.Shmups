# Mario Maker part 2

With the new lens of better understanding level design from Scott Roger's chapter on it in his book "Level Up", the class took another shot at mario maker.

The narrative of the level is to step on those under you to get to the top!

In the level, you jump on the enemies to progress; they are both simulataniously enemies but also vital platforms to interface with. This is shown by the simplicity of the level, as to not distract the player with too many "red herrings" and giving the hint of, "here's an enemy, that's it!" 

The way it's physically structured also alludes of "getting to the top" because of the upward momentum of the game.

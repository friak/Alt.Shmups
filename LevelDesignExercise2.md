# Mario Maker part 2

With the new lens of better understanding level design from Scott Roger's chapter on it in his book Level, the class took another shot at mario maker.

The narrative of the level is to step on those under you to get to the top!

In the level, you jump on the enemies to progress; you must interface with every enemy as well.

The way it's physically structured also alludes of "getting to the top" because of the upward momentum of the game.

# Mario Maker part 2

With the new lens of better understanding level design from Scott Roger's chapter on it in his book "Level Up", the class took another shot at mario maker.

The narrative of the level is to step on those under you to get to the top!

In the level, you jump on the enemies to progress; they are both simulataniously enemies but also vital platforms to interface with. This is shown by the simplicity of the level, as to not distract the player with too many "red herrings" and giving the hint of, "here's an enemy, that's it!" 

The way it's physically structured also alludes of "getting to the top" because of the upward momentum of the game.

The lineance toward the gamer is shown through the first three goombas or "three tries" to get to the first platform. Then, another goomba to reiterate the technique the player just learned. Last is tricky because of the spiked blocks, but now the player understands that yes, they are too supposed to be used as platforms most likely. The player can then twirl onto the block enemies safely, given lineance with how the blocks can come back up, and the player can keep twirling on the blocks to regain momentum.

Five game ideas for the final

## OctaOut!

An alt input game where the player is an octopus trying to leave a sushi restaurant using stealth and squeezing into objects. Using flex sensors, the player's fingers would be the octopus's legs

## Papers Please but Public Schools

A task managing game where you're a teacher grading students and managing a class in a poor public school. Mo' budget cuts, Mo' problems

## Yakuza Sushi Restaurant

Also like Papers Please, Sushi place that influences the politics of the Yakuza; go as long as you can without getting caught

## Birds Eye view game Prey vs Predator

Split screen game where one person is flying over the map trying to find the second player and the second player is in first person view of someone on ground being hunted. City scape environment

## Continuing Shouting Match

But that's dumb, I can do that outside of class on my own time.

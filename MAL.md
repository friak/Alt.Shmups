# MAL Visit Journal

At the MAL (MEdia Archeology Lab), the class had a few retro games that we played. 

One of the games that I played was the imfamous E.T. video game that basically caused the game crash of '83. The interface was awful in a few ways:


The controller was just the old Atari joystick, which felt uncomfortable in terms of the stiffness and material of the joystick and the  placement and latent repsonse of the single button. But that's how retro controllers go. Joysticks are still used today for movement in game controllers, but the ergonomics and haptic feel of joysticks have greatly improved. We've also added more buttons! And generally more sohpistication with controller design as well.


I also played this weird handheld "pinball" game by Microvision. 

It was called pinball, but it felt more like brick breaker without bricks. The "paddle" was moved with a dial in the bottom of the handheld and there were other buttons labeled, "BALLS", "SPEED" "PADDLE", and "GO". Only BALLS and GO seemed to do anything. The buttons were also weird and uncomfortable with its haptics as they were flat, rectangular indentations with a plastic film above. These kinds of buttons are still used today, though not necessarily with game controllers. The dial was a bit novel and fun to play with, but it was awkwardly positioned, and as a left-hended person, I especially didn't know how to hold the handheld in an optimal way. I don't see dials in game controllers anymore; I wonder if there's an effiecient and meaningful way of incorporating dials though, as it felt good hatically outside its awkward placement.

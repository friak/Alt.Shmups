Five "out-of the-box" ideas for shmups

1. Sâ€™up: The Social Anxiety Shmup
The idea for this game is that the bullets are conversations, mannerisms, vibes, etc. that the protagonist must manuever around in a bullet storm. Powerups can be a myriad of metaphors like other friends, self confidence, topics in common, to help boost the player's socializing skills. There can also be meters to consider that gauge "Extrovert energy" and "Awkwardness" "Anxiety" to also further deepen the mechanics and gameplay. It's a tongue and cheek look into the troubles of engaging with others on a day to day basis and visually and literally showcase them in an interactive shmup experience.

2. Katamari/Kirby Air Ride Shmup
Katamari is a game about an alien that rolls objects up with a katamari or sticky ball thing, and the main goal of the game is to get to a specific circumfrence from accumulating enough objects in a certain amount of time. The twist on this classic game series for my shmup idea is that now the player has to avoid non roll-upable items while roll up specific objects for the katamari for one half of the level. The next half of the level is to use the kind of katamari that the player rolled up as ammo to now shoot down what was attacking the player before. Rolling up certain objects can give the player certain power ups, almost like Kirby Air Ride where you have to accumulate power ups for your vehicle and then battle against your friends in the next half of the level.

3. Five Second Rule Shmup
The premise of the game is that the player is a piece of food that's fallen on the ground, and you have five seconds to keep from being contaminated before you're picked back up from the ground. The game mechanics work in a way where the first half of the level is to strategize a game plan to survive in 5 real time seconds of the second half of the level. This part of the level of contemplation doesn't have a time limit but it is where the player can surveliance the surrounding area of it's navigation through bacteria, bacteria bullets, and "gross spots" as well as power ups (clean tissues to rest on for the time being or hand sanitizer to shoot at bacteria) There's also the idea of trial and error where the player has an infinite amount of times to pass the level (it is five seconds after all) and in this trial and error, the player can begin to see patterns of the bullet of how the enemies move, and this adapt. The score is dependent though of how little times you fail the level before passing it.

4. 3D FPS Shmup
It would be interesting to play a shmup in the perspective of an FPS where the bullet storms are suspended in a three-dimentional space, and the players have to traverse the map with the added strategiing of dodging bullets in an x, y, and now z plane. 

5. Portal but a Shmup
This can be like the 3D FPS shmup stated above, but with the added mechanic of using portals and all the fun puzzle elements of portal to get to areas that are attack range for enemies and avoiding enemy bullets.
